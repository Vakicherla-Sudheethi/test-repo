validate the forms in angular
=============================
1.template driven form
----------------------
we design and validate in html file
these are simple,quick to get started and
perfect for simple forms

one disadvantage is that
the business rule and http are coupled and 
no unit tetsing is performed

we can use only directives.to 
create ,access and validate form elements
to bind data to view we use FORMS Module

1.NgModel
2.NgModelGroup
3.NgForm-represent entire form ,here we have bind 
ngForm object to local ref variable 
#userForm
-it contains entire form info
and we can use validators
we can do that in validate in 2 ways
1.built in
---------
require
minLength
maxLength
pattern
email
2.custom validation
---------------------
like booking date or order date
like we need to do the validation based on 
our requirement

to make use of NgModel and NgForm we
use the FORMS 
module

NgSubmit--its an event
NgForm
NgSubmit
we use these !! 
-------------------------------------------
2.reactive form
the developer builds all the control and logi
of validation of form
in component typescript file.

we dont use forms module to bind the data 
from the view.

we use a FormGroup,FormControlName,

we create a form by usig formGroup class
within the form we define form controls 
and we give validators.

we use ngOnInit--life cycle method
this method invokes after constuctor is 
invoked.
we do validations within the control.

{FormGroup}--is the object of form
{FormBuilder}
{Validators} we need to import these
