Angular Directives
-----------------------------

The Angular directives are used to manipulate the DOM.

Directives are instructions in the DOM. They specify how to place your components and business logic in the Angular.

By using Angular directives, you can change the appearance, behavior or a layout of a DOM element. It also helps you to extend HTML. I

OnInit - its loaded before the component is loaded

Angular directives can be classified in 3 categories based on how they behave:

1.Component Directives

2.Structural Directives

3.Attribute Directives
-------------------------------------------------
1.Component Directives: The Component is also a type of directive in
angular with its own template, styles, and logic needed for the view. The Component Directive is the most widely used directive in the angular application and you cannot create an angular application without a component.
===================================
2.Structural Directives: Structural directives start with a * sign. These directives are used to manipulate and change the structure of the DOM elements. *ngIf directive, *ngSwitch directive, and *ngFor directive.

*ngIf Directive: The ngIf allows us to Add/Remove DOM Element.
conditionally we render the date into the document.

*ngSwitch Directive: The *ngSwitch allows us to Add/Remove DOM Element. It is similar to switch statement of C#.

*ngFor Directive: The *ngFor directive is used to repeat a portion of HTML template once per each item from an iterable list (Array/Collection).
========================================
3.Attribute Directives: These directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. They do this by manipulating the element they are attached to. Examples include ngStyle for dynamically setting CSS styles and ngClass for dynamically adding or removing CSS classes.

ngClass is used to conditionally apply CSS classes to an element based on the truthiness of expressions.

ngStyle allows for the application of inline styles conditionally based on specified conditions.
