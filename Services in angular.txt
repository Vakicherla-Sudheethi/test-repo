Services in angular
--------------------------
-we use it to build API - as to write business logic
that business logic we can use across multiple controllers
-similarly in agular we have service class
-once we write funcationality in multi class we can expose that to angular application

-Services are great way to share nfo bw the components without knowing to each other

app-----> comp1--------->service
      ------->comp2

-we use the same code in muliple compnents in that case services we use and we use services among variours components.

Features of services:
=================
1.)Typescript classes with injectable decorators.
2)services are used to share a single piece of code accross multiple components 
3)components used to display and present the data .services use to fetch the data from the API
4)services are used to interact with the backend API.

-services is a class .decorated with injectable component, thereshare the same piece pf code that holds the bisness logic and interact with backend and share among the components 

-services are SINGLETON.one instance is created and we use by building bblock of every app
-services are part of module i.e part of component and you'll have ti specify the array in module
