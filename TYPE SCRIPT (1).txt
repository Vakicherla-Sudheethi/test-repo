TYPE SCRIPT
--------------
- some basically TypeScript is like a scripting language is it is like a programming language that we can use it client side like C sharp is also a programming language.
-Java is also a programming language, but C sharp and Java.
-We are using it server side whereas JavaScript is a programming language.
-TypeScript TypeScript is a client side programming language.
-We are using TypeScript in angular application development.
- in angular application to write business logic in client side also you're going to write logic right
-Without typeScript we cannot use the angular
-type script is superset of Java script to execute this we use browser that has java VIT engine
-by using browser and without browser we can run RUN i.e we use NODE JS(Run time for java based applications)
-we cannot run Type script directly from broswer as it has only java interpreters

Type script ---->compile ------->generates the JS(this can be executed)
File.ts                    [TSC]                File.js

-TSC->Type Script Compiler

 first you're going to write TypeScript and once you compile it, it will generate a JavaScript.
>further this JavaScript code, either you can execute using browser or node because you can't execute this TypeScript to code directly to execute a TypeScript to code faster you compile so it will generate a JavaScript and that JavaScript you can either execute by using browser or you can use node.
>That means whatever the features you use in JavaScript, all we can use in TypeScript, it is a language designed for large scale JavaScript application development.
>the TypeScript we are using in angular application development and in coming days we are using angular.We are using TypeScript for React applications as well.

TypeScript is the ES6 version of JS

-----------------------------------------------------
Version of type Script 
 we use node to develop JS



-------------------------------------------------------
getting started with JS





























Type Script is an open source and its client side OOPS language 
-We can create classes,Objects and We can access members ,inheriatnce etc
