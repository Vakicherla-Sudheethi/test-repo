Connection Bw Front end and Backend
-----------------------------------------------------
Angular(front end) it cannot directly connect to DB
we use Middleware


angular -----------------> middleware ----------------->Database
(Front end )                      (API)                                        (MSSQL)

-to build API we can use ASP DOT NET,java and Node also

Mobile APP (flutter)       HTTP
Front end(Angular)    -------------> Middleware ----------->database
Front end (React)


-once we build API the advantage As it is RESTful service or HTTP service , that Service is connected to different client application . 

as we connect API to any technology .How do they communicate ?
-----------------------------------------
>As Angular can understand and API can also understand JSON 

 JSON helps organize the information, and HTTP makes sure it gets from one place to another over the internet. Together, they're like sending well-packaged letters back and forth between your computer and another one

when an API is communicate with any client, they just communicated via HTTP and they use data exchanging in between JSON.

What are the open standards it uses to communicate client to API & API to client?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It uses HTTP and Jason HTTP for communication.
JSON is for data exchange, so these are called as what open standard protocols.

when an API is communicate with any client, they just communicated via HTTP and they use data exchanging in between JSON.

As Angular doenst understand C# so we go with HTTP and JSON

when your ASP.NET Core backend wants to send a message back to your Angular frontend, it writes a "letter" in the same special language (creates JSON data). This "letter" is then sent back to Angular, which can easily read and understand the information inside.
