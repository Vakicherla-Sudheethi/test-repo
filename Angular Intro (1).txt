It runs on type script
-AngularJS is a JavaScript framework written in JavaScript.
>Client base Application - it runs with in browser
>Server base application - ASP .NET CORE MVC,ASP .NET CORE API,SPRING BOOT,PHP
-Browser is a tool through whuc we make req through API
-Server side applications run on web server like MVC,Kestral or ISS express
-when ever we click on start in code it uses Kestral or IIS server 
we also use TomCat Apache which is used in real time
-with out websever we cannot use server side application
-the port that we get is the kestral webserver i.e local host// etc

>Kester runs on windows,mac and linux but IIS is only on windows to run applcations

>By using html we use static web page,like college web site
the server is not required for this .
>A clinet side application runs in the browser without server i.e ANGULAR,REACT,VIEW,NODE etc are diff frameworks
>and when it uses server we call it server side application i.e ASP DOT NET,CORE
